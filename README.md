# ðŸ”¦ FarmNerðŸ”¦

FarmNer is the second game I've ever made. It was made using the Godot game engine in GDScript. It is a horror game with a health bar, item looting, and AI that can target and attack you. This particular game taught me how to use Godot's tools more efficiently and how to manage a larger game.
