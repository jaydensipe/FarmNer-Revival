# 🔦 FarmNer 🔦

FarmNer was the second game I've ever created. It was made using the Godot game engine in GDScript. It is a horror game with a health bar, item looting, and AI that can target and attack you. This game taught me how to use Godot's tools more efficiently and how to manage a larger game.
